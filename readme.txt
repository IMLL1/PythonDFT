DFTfuncs.py is the DFT function (functions, later). I intend on adding FFT instead of just the slower one. This file is required for both python scripts
input.csv contains the data. It is also required, and can be edited as neede

signalAnalysis presents some fourier transform information about a singal (specifically, the signal in input.txt)
signalCompress trims a signal down to only its most dominant frequencies. The number of frequencies can be selected by the user.
