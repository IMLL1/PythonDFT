DFT_function.py is the DFT function. Later I'll make it FFT. This file is required for both python scripts
input.txt contains the data. It is also required, and can be edited as neede

fourierFinal presents some fourier transform information about a singal (specifically, the signal in input.txt)
trimFourier trims a signal down to only its most dominant frequencies. The number of frequencies can be selected by the user.
